# Avr Saturation Arithmetic
A library of saturation arithmetic types hand-optimised for AVR processors

---

This project originally started as an innocent experiment through which to practise using inline assembly.  
Features creeped in and now it's a handy little lightweight library.

I hope to evolve it over time (e.g. provide other operators and support for processors without the `MUL` opcode).
